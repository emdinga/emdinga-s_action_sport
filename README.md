##FOOTBALL ON COURT AFRICA

With a passion for soccer and for people, Emdinga Mbhamali is out to create a world-class 5-a-side facility in Durban. After years of visualizing, planning, and a lot of determination we finally got it right when we opened FOCA – Football On Court Africa

Our FOCA venues merge the indoor soccer 5-a-side format with the outdoors artificial turf courts to create a unique playing experience second to none. Our courts are constructed using the best quality synthetic grass, and with a surrounding low wall and high net structure – provides a one-of-a-kind venue that can be enjoyed by anyone and everyone with all levels of fitness and skill

Whether you want to join a team, enter a league, have a birthday party, organize a corporate function, or just kick around with friends – FOCA has the venue for you.
